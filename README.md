# cock-heroine
A tool for recording, editing and playing beat patterns for cock hero videos

# why?
The year is 2015. Cock Hero movies have been around for a while, but technology hasn't caught up yet.
Some Cock Hero videos have simple beats - maybe they're a bit boring. Others have intricate and difficult ones - that's fun, but getting them right takes your attention away from the video. If only there was a better way...
Neither the fleshlight launch nor funscripts will emerge for a couple of years, and 'beats only' tracks are a distant fantasy.
The author has an arduino, a collection of vibrating toys, and a mission: to make them play cock hero.

# Is this another funscript editor?
No, for all of the reasons above.  
But, as they are a popular file format for storing sex hardware instructions, funscripts are supported.

# So what does it do then?
Cock Heroine is designed specifically with Cock Hero games in mind.  
You can store timestamps for all the events, just like you can with a funscript, but these events aren't tied to particular hardware.  
You can import funscripts, or record events on-the-fly, and then use the editor to make sure they're prefectly in time with the music.
Then you can use them to control hardware and play back the events.
